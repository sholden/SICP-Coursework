Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are
compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the
following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

Answer:
a-plus-abs-b uses a conditional to determine whether to add or 
subtract b to effect the absolute value operation.
