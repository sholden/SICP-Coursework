; Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an
; approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by the
; value

; x/yÂ² + 2y
; ----------
;     3

; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root
; procedure. (In section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newton's method in
; general as an abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)
